Penn State Computer Science 131 (Programming and Computation I: Fundamentals):
This course introduces the fundamental concepts and processes of solving computational problems through the design, implementation, testing and evaluation of efficient and robust computer programs. The concepts include basic computational constructs found in imperative, object-oriented and functional programming languages such as iteration, conditionals, functions, recursion, and datatypes. These provide the basic building blocks found in virtually all programming languages. The processes include the stepwise refinement of a problem description into individual components that can be implemented, tested, and integrated into an effective solution. A central theme to the course is computational thinking which includes a wide range of approaches to solving problems and designing systems that draw upon concepts fundamental to computer science.
